## About The Project
As you initiate the project, you'll encounter the menu page, which features a few buttons. Its appearance is rather simple, considering that this marks my initial venture into Java programming.

By clicking the __Employee Entry__ button, you'll be directed to a page where you can input and add new employee details to the database.

To update employee details, navigate to the __Employee Update__ button. This allows you to modify and revise the information stored in the database.

To retrieve comprehensive information about a specific employee, utilize the __Employee Searching__ button. This feature enables you to search and access all relevant details in the database.

  <tr>

    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Employee_Database/blob/main/employeedb-ss/Screenshot-5.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

With the __Employee Listing__ button, you'll find a comprehensive display of all employee information organized in ascending order based on their respective employee ID numbers.

Upon clicking the __Exit__ button, a confirmation window will appear, prompting you to confirm your intention. Depending on your response, the system will either proceed with the exit or remain active.
